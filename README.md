## Overview

**SimpleAndClean** aims to deliver as clean of a UI as possible without nipping functionality. It ensures seamless integration and customizability for both casual users and developers alike.

Please note this is an active projectâ€”if you encounter issues or visual inconsistencies, open an issue so I can fix it promptly. Thank you for supporting the theme! :3

## Features

- **No branding or titlebar**  
  Keep things clean. Use native Windows shortcuts like `Win + â†‘` or `Win + â†“` to manage window sizing.
> [!TIP]
> With the title bar removed, you may want to install [AltSnap](https://github.com/RafaelBergson/AltSnap) â€“ a lightweight utility that lets you drag/resize windows by holding `Alt` and clicking anywhere in the window.

- **Full Vencord compatibility**  
  Built and tested with Vencord to ensure consistent experience.

- **Custom background and icons**  
  Personalize your setup with aesthetic visuals that still feel native to Discord.
  
- **Pre Visual Refresh styling**  
  Restores some of the older styling decisions like circlular guild icons.
  
- **Extensive color palette**  
  A wide range of colors to match your style and mood.

- **Accessibility first design**  
  Prioritizes accessible features so they will always work.

- **Developer-friendly comments**  
  Every element is clearly labeled in the source, making it easy to tweak and extend.
