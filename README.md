# SimpleAndClean ![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/akrossu/SimpleAndClean?logo=github&include_prereleases=&sort=semver&color=62b061&style=flat-square) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/344266404993826817?logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=discord&color=7289DA&style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/ANgfZVa)

The objective of this theme is to achieve as clean of a UI as possible without nipping functionality. This theme is still new so please allow me to work out anything I may have missed and if you find something, please open an issue or else I may not know if something has broken or not yet been themed. Thank you for using my theme :3

> Note that my prior [Modified Rounded Dark](https://github.com/akrossu/ModifiedRoundedDark) theme is more than likely not going see any further updates and development will move to this theme.

## Features
- No branding or toolbar.
    - You may use windows function keys such as win+up or win+down to maximize and minimize discord.
- Highly customizable (if anyone has a link to the theme customizer thing plugin pls send it to me)
- Per radius and margin element size adjustability.
- Huge color pallete.
- Additionally, I try to comment exactly what every element does so if you're a developer or want to make even more changes, it's easy to see where to do so!
